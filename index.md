# About

I am an atmospheric scientist interested in using simple models of energy transfer in Earth’s atmosphere to explain our climate. My primary interests are rainfall, tropical convection, and radiative transfer. 

Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher with [Robert Pincus](https://crew.ldeo.columbia.edu/people/robert-pincus) and [Lorenzo Polvani](https://www.columbia.edu/~lmp/) at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, studying how global mean rainfall increases with surface temeprature and how increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide impact the stratospheric lapse rate. Prior to this, I earned my PhD in Applied Math and Atmospheric Science at Columbia University under the mentorship of [Adam Sobel](https://www.columbia.edu/~ahs129/home.html) and [Michela Biasutti](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~biasutti/), where we used idealized models to explain the mechanisms controlling the spatial pattern of tropical rainfall. 

Before entering the climate space, I worked as a thermal engineer at Ball Aerospace, designing and analyzing cooling systems aboard satellites and aircraft. However, I soon discovered I enjoyed explaining complex systems more so than making them - and what better complex system to (try to) explain than Earth's climate.
