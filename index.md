# About

I am an atmospheric scientist interested in using simple models of energy transfer in Earthâ€™s atmosphere to explain our climate. My primary interests are rainfall, tropical convection, and radiative transfer. I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher with Robert Pincus and Lorenzo Polvani at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
